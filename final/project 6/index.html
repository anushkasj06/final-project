                    C is a general-purpose programming language created 
                    by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a very popular language, 
                    despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental
                    language in the field of computer science.C is strongly associated with UNIX, as
                    it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

                <ul>
                    <li>It has inbuilt functions and operators that can solve virtually any complex problem</li><br>
                    <li>C is the combination of both low level (assembly) and high-level programming languages; also, it can be used to write an application and interact 
                        with low-level system memory and hardware</li><br>
                    <li>It can be written on practically any operating system and even works in most handheld devices</li><br>

                    C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple, and flexible to use. 
                    It is a structured programming language that is machine-independent and extensively used to write various applications,
                    Operating Systems like Windows, and many other complex programs like Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and more.
                    It is said that ‘C’ is a god’s programming language. One can say, C is a base for the programming.
                    If you know ‘C,’ you can easily grasp the knowledge of the other programming languages that uses the concept of ‘C’

                To get start with writing your first code "Hello World!"<br>
                <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
                </code><br>
                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
          browser!

              <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
                The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
                rules.
              </p><br>
              <p>
                A C language identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
                Because C is case sensitive, letters include the characters
                "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
                (lowercase).
              </p><br>
              <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
                identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
                characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
